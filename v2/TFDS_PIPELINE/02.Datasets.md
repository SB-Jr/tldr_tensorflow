# Versioning Dataset

Every dataset is versioned so that if it evolces we can always refer to a specific version.

Usually it is nubered `<dataset-name>:x.y.z`

Where:
- x is the Major version number
    - i.e. new data has been added
- y is the Minor version number
    - i.e. new features has been added like new slicing or proper semantics of the labels
- z is the Patch version number
    - i.e. the disk serial number of the data has been changed or very minute details are changed
    
If we need the latest version of a dataset belonging to a specific major version eg: A then we can do the following
```
    dataset = tfds.load('<dataset-name>:A.*.*')
```
This will load A version's latest dataset.


# Splits


TFDS uses split names to segregate the data into train, test, validation and all segments. We can use the `tfds.Split.TRAIN`, `tfds.Split.TEST`, `tfds.Split.VALIDATION` or `tfds.Split.ALL` repsectively. Sometimes the split names can be custom and we can use the custom name rather than the predefined split names. Eg:
```
    split_obj = tfds.Split('custom_split_name')
    dataset_split = tfds.load('<dataset-name>', split=split_obj)
```

# Dataset Builder

Dataset loading goes through a series of processes on its own before the actual database is loaded. This is done under the hood by the DatasetBuilder class. Eg:
```
    # pickk dataset
    mnist_builder = tfds.builder('mnist')
    
    # download the dataset
    mnist_builder.download_and_prepare()
    
    # extract the dataset
    mnist_builder.as_dataset(split=tfds.Split.TRAIN) # if we want only the training data
```
