Instead of representing age as a numeric column, we could split the age into several buckets using a bucketized column. Notice the one-hot values below describe which age range each row matches. Buckets include the left boundary, and exclude the right boundary. For example, consider raw data that represents the year a house was built. Instead of representing that year as a scalar numeric column, we could split the year into the following four buckets:<br>\n",

Well, notice that the categorization splits a single input number into a four-element vector.

    "Suppose instead of having just a few possible strings, we have thousands (or more) values per category. For a number of reasons, as the number of categories grow large, it becomes infeasible to train a neural network using one-hot encodings. We can use an embedding column to overcome this limitation. Instead of representing the data as a one-hot vector of many dimensions, an embedding column represents that data as a lower-dimensional, dense vector in which each cell can contain any number, not just 0 or 1.  an indicator column treats each category as an element in a one-hot vector, where the matching category has value 1 and the rest have 0s.<br>\n",

    "<img src='artifacts/embeded_column.jpeg'/><br>\n",
    "When an example is processed, one of the categorical_column_with… functions maps the example string to a numerical categorical value. You may then represent these numerical categorical values in either of the following two ways:\n",
    "- As an indicator column. A function converts each numeric categorical value into an 81-element vector (because our palette consists of 81 words), placing a 1 in the index of the categorical value (0, 32, 79, 80) and a 0 in all the other positions.\n",
    "- As an embedding column. A function uses the numerical categorical values (0, 32, 79, 80) as indices to a lookup table. Each slot in that lookup table contains a 3-element vector.<br>\n",
    "How do the values in the embeddings vectors magically get assigned? Actually, the assignments happen during training. That is, the model learns the best way to map your input numeric categorical values to the embeddings vector value in order to solve your problem. Embedding columns increase your model’s capabilities, since an embeddings vector learns new relationships between categories from the training data."
